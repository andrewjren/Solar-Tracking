#README

This is a solar tracking & fine adjustment algorithm implemented on an Arduino. 

### Todo

	- Sync up Arduino time with PC time so that Solar tracker stays synchronized
	- Take into account tilt angles so that Azimuth and Zenith angles are with respect to normal
	- Write a unit test driver
	- Add some fine adjustment algorithm
